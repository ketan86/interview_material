"""
There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which
we donâ€™t know the ordering of the characters. Write a method to find the
correct order of characters in the alien language.

Example 1:

Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
Output: bac
Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules
of the alien language, so
from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its
characters:
 
1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'
 
From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character
order is: "bac"
Example 2:

Input: Words: ["cab", "aaa", "aab"]
Output: cab
Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering
among its characters:
 
1. From "cab" and "aaa", we can conclude that 'c' comes before 'a'.
2. From "aaa" and "aab", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'b'
 
From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order
is: "cab"
Example 3:

Input: Words: ["ywx", "wz", "xww", "xz", "zyy", "zwz"]
Output: ywxz
Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among
its characters:
 
1. From "ywx" and "wz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'.
2. From "wz" and "xww", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'x'.
3. From "xww" and "xz", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'z'
4. From "xz" and "zyy", we can conclude that 'x' comes before 'z'
5. From "zyy" and "zwz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'
 
From the above five points, we can conclude that the correct character order
is: "ywxz"

    By comparing adjacent word, we can determine the order of the char in
    the dictionary. we need to only compare the first different char between
    adjacent words to form the graph since words are in lexicographical
    order. By running the topological sort, we can determine the correct
    order of characters in the alien language.
