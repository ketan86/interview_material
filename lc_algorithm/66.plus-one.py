#
# Given a non-empty array of digitsÂ representing a non-negative integer, plus
# one to the integer.
#
# The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of
# the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.
#
# You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the
# number 0 itself.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,4]
# Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [4,3,2,1]
# Output: [4,3,2,2]
# Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
