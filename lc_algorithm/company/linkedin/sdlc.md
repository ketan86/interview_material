**Product Owner:**

1. Act as a Product Leader, not as an 'Agile project manager'

2. Be Product Oriented instead of Project Oriented

3. Focus on time-to-learn over time-to-market.

4. Take responsibilities of the success of the product.

5. Understand that more analysis does not make the product better

6. Market Research, Sales, and Marketing are part of the responsibilities.

7. Focus on increasing value(outcome) instead of increasing velocity(output).

8. Be Dolphin, not a Submarine.
   - be visible like dolphin for customers instead of submarine.
