By definition, reliability is the probability a system will fail in a given
period. In simple terms, a distributed system is considered reliable if it
keeps delivering its services even when one or several of its software or
hardware components fail. Reliability represents one of the main
characteristics of any distributed system, since in such systems any failing
machine can always be replaced by another healthy one, ensuring the completion
of the requested task.

Take the example of a large electronic commerce store (like Amazon), where one
of the primary requirement is that any user transaction should never be
canceled due to a failure of the machine that is running that transaction. For
instance, if a user has added an item to their shopping cart, the system is
expected not to lose it. A reliable distributed system achieves this through
redundancy of both the software components and data. If the server carrying the
userâ€™s shopping cart fails, another server that has the exact replica of the
shopping cart should replace it.

Obviously, redundancy has a cost and a reliable system has to pay that to
achieve such resilience for services by eliminating every single point of
failure.
