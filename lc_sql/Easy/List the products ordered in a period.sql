-- Question 45
-- Table: Products

-- +------------------+---------+
-- | Column Name      | Type    |
-- +------------------+---------+
-- | product_id       | int     |
-- | product_name     | varchar |
-- | product_category | varchar |
-- +------------------+---------+
-- product_id is the primary key for this table.
-- This table contains data about the company's products.
-- Table: Orders

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | product_id    | int     |
-- | order_date    | date    |
-- | unit          | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- There is no primary key for this table. It may have duplicate rows.
-- product_id is a foreign key to Products table.
-- unit is the number of products ordered in order_date.


-- Write an SQL query to get the names of products with greater than or
-- equal to 100 units ordered in February 2020 and their amount.

-- Return result table in any order.

-- The query result format is in the following example:



-- Products table:

-- +--------------------+---------+

-- Products with product_id = 1 is ordered in February a total of (60 + 70) = 130.
-- Products with product_id = 2 is ordered in February a total of 80.
-- Products with product_id = 3 is ordered in February a total of (2 + 3) = 5.
-- Products with product_id = 4 was not ordered in February 2020.
-- Products with product_id = 5 is ordered in February a total of (50 + 50) = 100.

-- Solution

SELECT product_name, o.unit as unit
FROM Products as p
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT product_id, SUM(unit) as unit
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY product_id
    HAVING order_date LIKE "2020-02%"
        ) as o
    ON o.product_id=p.product_id
WHERE SUM(o.unit) >= 100

-- Join and group by in one
SELECT product_name, SUM(unit) as unit
FROM Products as p
    INNER JOIN Orders as o
    ON p.product_id=o.product_id
WHERE o.order_date LIKE "2020-02%"
GROUP BY p.product_id
HAVING SUM(unit) >= 100

-- Solution 3
Select a.product_name, a.unit
from
    (select p.product_name, sum(unit) as unit
    from orders o
        join products p
        on o.product_id = p.product_id
    where month(order_date)=2 and year(order_date) = 2020
    group by o.product_id) a
where a.unit>=100
