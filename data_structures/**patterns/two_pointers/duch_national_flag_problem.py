"""
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t
count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue;
and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is
why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 1 2]
Example 2:

Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]
