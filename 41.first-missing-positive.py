        Instead of using cyclic sort n^2, this algorithm marks
        numbers negative if they are at the right position.

        for ex, [2,1,0] (-2,-1,0) becomes (-2+4, -1+4, 0+4)
                     *
                [2,1,4]

            abs(2) = 2 & 2 > 3, false so 2 should be placed at 1st position
            so mark 1st position where 1 is located to -1
            [2,-1,4]

            abs(-1) = 1 & 1 > 3, false so 1 should be placed at the 0th
            position. mark 0th position where 2 is located to -2

            abs(4) = 4 & 4 > 3 so exit

            now check the first non-negative number and the index of that
            number is the missing number.
