In the previous section, we discussed how we could create processes using fork
as the start method. However, fork comes with shortcomings of its own and may
not be what we want. The next option available to create a process is the spawn
method.

exec system call:

In order to understand spawn, we'll examine the exec family of
system calls. When you issue an ls or a find command in your terminal, the
shell first forks itself and then invokes one of the variants of the exec
family of system calls. Briefly, an exec call transforms the calling process
into another. The program in the calling process is replaced with another
program and is run from the entry point. Realize the distinction between a
program and a process as it matters in this context. The program is just a set
of instructions and data that is used to initialize a process. Using exec, the
running process loads a program (instructions and data) and replaces its own
program with the loaded one and starts execution.

Both fork and exec can be called independently and need not be called in
succession. For instance, a process that is ending can simply call exec and
start another program rather than forking itself. Similarly, a process
listening on a socket may want to fork itself to let the child process deal
with a received request while it goes back to listening. But the usual way to
create a new process in the Unix world is to first fork in the parent process
and then exec in the child process. The child process's PID doesn't change and
the parent process can wait for the child process to finish before resuming
execution.

Remember, forking produces two processes, whereas exec loads an executable in
the existing process's address space. The current executable image is replaced
with another one loaded from an executable file.

spawn call With the above background, it is easier to explain the "spawn" start
method. Spawn is essentially a combination of fork followed by an exec (one of
its variants) system call. Depending on the platform, posix_spawn system call
may also be used. posix_spawn is roughly a combination of fork and exec with
some optional housekeeping steps between the two calls.

This solves the problem we encountered with fork start method. The module state
isnâ€™t inherited by a child process, rather it starts from scratch. A new python
interpreter process is created and the child doesn't inherit any resources from
the parent process other than those required to execute the specified callable
target.

Note that spawning a process is slower than forking a process. When a child
process is spawned anything imported at the module level in the __main__ module
of the parent process gets reimported in the child. Consider the example below.
If you change the start method to "spawn" on line 14, you'll see that the print
messages in the imported modules are printed twice. Once when the main process
runs and once when the child process runs. However, running the snippet with
"fork" as the start method will only have the modules imported once for the
main process.

Example:

Let's revisit our program from the previous section where a child
process inherits a file descriptor from the parent process and is able to write
to it. This would not be possible under the spawn start method.

Running the below code will result in an error because the value of the
variable file_desc isn't copied over to the child process.

the change in the Test class's variable isn't reflected in the child process if
the start method is specified to be spawn.

"""
Note that if we pass any arguments to the process's callable target, the child
process does receive them. This is in line with the documentation that says the
child process inherits just enough resources from the parent process to execute
the run method of the process object.

"""
Use of Pickling Arguments to the child process are sent using pickle. Pickle is
a module used for serializing and deserializing an object. The object is
serialized into a stream of bytes by the sender and then reconstructed into a
different incarnation of the same object from the byte stream by the receiver.
Multiprocessing uses pickle to transport data between processes. This mandates
that the arguments being passed to the child process be picklable i.e. they can
be serialized. Consider the below snippet, where we attempt to pass a Lock
object from the threading module to a process and get an error saying the
argument isn't picklable.
