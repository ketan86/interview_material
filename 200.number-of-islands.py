# Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of
# islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting
# adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of
# the grid are all surrounded by water.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# 11110
# 11010
# 11000
# 00000
# 
# Output:Â 1

# Example 2:

# Input:
# 11000
# 11000
# 00100
# 00011

# Output: 3

        when we land on the island, we explore the island till we find the
        water and then return 1 to represent that island.

            11110
            11010
            11000
            00000
        at index [0][0], if is 1, we start exploring the island on all
        sides. before exploring all sides, we mark the current index `0`
        to indicate that it has been visited. During the exploration, we
        will either cover all grid cells if all of them are 1 or the land
        that is attached to index[0][0]. once we find water (0's) on all
        the directions, we stop and consider the whole exploration a 1 island.

        we expolore all indexes and all the land around each index if it is
        a land.

        all these islands are summed together to find total islands.
