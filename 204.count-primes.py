    What are Prime Numbers?

    In math, prime numbers are whole numbers greater than 1, that have only two
    factors â€“ 1 and the number itself. Prime numbers are divisible only by the
    number 1 or itself.

    For example, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11 are the first few prime numbers.

    0 is not prime, because you can not create any new number by having it as a
    factor. 1 was considered prime at some time, but was dropped because many
    rules for primes would need to make a special case exemption for 1 - which
    was impractical.
