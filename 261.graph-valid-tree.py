# Testcase Example:  '5\n[[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]'
#
# Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge
# is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a
# valid tree.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]
# Output: true
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [1,4]]
# Output: false
# 
# Note: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all
# edges are undirected, [0,1] is the same as [1,0] and thus will not appear
# together in edges.
