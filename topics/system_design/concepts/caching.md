Load balancing helps you scale horizontally across an ever-increasing number of
servers, but caching will enable you to make vastly better use of the resources
you already have as well as making otherwise unattainable product requirements
feasible. Caches take advantage of the locality of reference principle:
recently requested data is likely to be requested again. They are used in
almost every layer of computing: hardware, operating systems, web browsers, web
applications, and more. A cache is like short-term memory: it has a limited
amount of space, but is typically faster than the original data source and
contains the most recently accessed items. Caches can exist at all levels in
architecture, but are often found at the level nearest to the front end where
they are implemented to return data quickly without taxing downstream levels.
