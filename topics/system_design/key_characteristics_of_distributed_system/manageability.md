Another important consideration while designing a distributed system is how
easy it is to operate and maintain. Serviceability or manageability is the
simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained; if the
time to fix a failed system increases, then availability will decrease. Things
to consider for manageability are the ease of diagnosing and understanding
problems when they occur, ease of making updates or modifications, and how
simple the system is to operate (i.e., does it routinely operate without
failure or exceptions?).

Early detection of faults can decrease or avoid system downtime. For example,
some enterprise systems can automatically call a service center (without human
intervention) when the system experiences a system fault.
